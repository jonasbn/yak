# Yak

This repository is the overall Yak project repository, it's goal is to specify the elements of the Yak project.

The Yak tool is a tool aimed at assisting in maintaining several repositories. It is a supplement to tools like [Dependabot], it is not as advanced as a bot, but it gets the job done.

Yak however is not language specific, but is aimed a assisting with all of the files, which are not related to a certain language.

Yak can help you to check if:

- A certain file is present
- A certain file holds specific contents based on a checksum
- A certain file holds specific contents based on a template

In addition to the above main use-cases, Yak can be configured to suit the basic needs for handling repository contents.

A key example:

> Make sure your repository contains a Code of Conduct

1. Add a file named `.yaksums.json` to your repository
1. Add the following below contents

```json
{
    "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md": true
}
```

Running Yak on your project now checks for the contents of a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, like so:

```text
‚ùóÔ∏èCODE_OF_CONDUCT.md failed
```

When you add the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` a new run will report a success:

```text
üëçüèª./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md succeeded
```

If you want to be more specific about the version of your `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, there are a few options available:

1. You can specify a checksum for the code of conduct, then Yak will check if the file in the repository holds the same checksum as you canonical version
1. Alternatively you can specify a path to a file in your filesystem, so the checksum is calculated dynamically

Lets start with the first option.

```json
{
    "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md": "da9eed24b35eed80ce28e07b02725dbb356cfa56500a1552a1410ab5c73af82c"
}
```

The checksum is a standard checksum based on SHA256.

The second option would look as follows:

```json
{
    "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md": "file://CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"
}
```

This points to a file in the configuration directory of Yak, meaning that canonical versions can easily be maintained in this directory as files and the repositories specified to this file, will report a failure if and when the file is updated and the file can easily be copied to the relevant repositories.
